### Overview

- This projects goal was to make a Robotic arm. The fun part was that there weren't any real specifications, so anything could happen. What we decided was to make a flex sensor controlled arm, that would mimic the fingers of an individual. In Theory, this arm could be used as a multi-purposed arm. It could pick up certain toxic objects that may be considered dangerous for humans to touch or come in contact with, being attached to a rover, used to test chemical reactions from a distance, additional virtual assistants, or even petting porcupines. The user could wear a glove with the flex sencors attached, and the hand does exactally what the controller does. It's a fairly Simple idea, but carrying it out is a whole other story.
